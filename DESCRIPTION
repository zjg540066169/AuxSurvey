Description: Probability surveys often use auxiliary continuous data from administrative records, but the utility of this data is diminished when it is discretized for confidentiality. We provide a set of survey estimators to make full use of information from the discretized variables. See Williams, S.Z., Zou, J., Liu, Y., Si, Y., Galea, S. and Chen, Q. (2024), Improving Survey Inference Using Administrative Records Without Releasing Individual-Level Continuous Data. Statistics in Medicine, 43: 5803-5813. <doi:10.1002/sim.10270> for details.
